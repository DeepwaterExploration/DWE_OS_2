# DWE_OS 2.0

DWE_OS is an optional piece of software — designed to run on underwater systems — that allows for extended functionality of [DeepWater Exploration cameras](https://dwe.ai/collections/all). It provides out-of-the-box camera streaming and customization features, minimizing the development time typically required for subsea camera integration.
